# Papier-api
An on demand book sharing platform.

Papier (meaning paper in french) is an application built for booklovers who desire the experience of a physical book for reading. The application provides an on demand platform for readers to share and rent books with their local community. 

The application is built using MERN stack. JWT's are used for securing and authorizing access to resources. It uses Uber-API's for on demand logistics and cloudinary's API for storing images into a CDN. Test's for the application are written using the mohca framework.
